A history of what I've done to setup this development environment so far.

Step 1: install Dev Containers extension for VSCode
Step 2: Create a .devcontainer folder and put a .devcontainer.json file in it. VSCode will build the container we need using these files
Step 3: I asked deepseek for a simple devcontainer.json to make a maven daemon project with. I've commented to container.json to hopefully provide insight on what means what.
