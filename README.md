### Setting up development environment (For Windows 10)

- Install Maven 3.9.10
- Make sure you are using Java 21. If you're not sure if you have it setup properly, look at the bullets below
  - Identify where you `jdk-21` folder is (Typically in `C:\Program Files\Java`)
  - Look up "environment variables" in the Windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables"
  - Select "Environment Variables"
  - Under "System Variables", if `JAVA_HOME` does not already exist, create it and set it to your `jdk-21`'s path. Save it.
  - Under "System Variables" click on "Path". If `%JAVA_HOME%/bin` is not already in the list, click "new" then add it and save it.
  - Select "ok" on all dialogs
- Pull project from repository
- Open IDE (Any IDE compatible with Maven works)

NOTE: Soon to be rewritten to be easier to setup
